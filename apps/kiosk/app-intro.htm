<p>This demo application illustrates 3 different ways of programming in MaxScript: CGI-mode, MaxObjects and Ajax
</p>
<p><b>CGI-Mode</b><br>
Everything is done in a single page.<br>
The page is reloaded every time the display is updated by the timer (written in 
javascript).<p><b>MaxObject</b><br>
Still a single page, but that calls itself recurively. Sane as above, t page is 
reloaded every time the display is updated.<p><b>Ajax-mode</b><br>
Asynchronous mode: the main page is never reloaded. All actions are performed 
form an other page (the actuator) that is permanently cached.
