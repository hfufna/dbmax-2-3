DBFree-DEV MaxScript reference manual
version BETA 0.1
Agust 21, 2011

This web is a porting of an existing application written for
DBMax and currently in use on our website, merged with the
existing CMD.local web application.

The whole porting required about 2 hours, including redesigning 
the user interface, but excluding debug (that is not done yet).

All porting consisted into creating a folder and copying in 
it the structure of CMD web, plus the necessary pages taken 
from the REFERENCE web.

Most of the time has been spent for amalgamating the appearence
so to hide that pages are coming from different applications.

MaxScript code has been modified slightly, mainly to move the 
check-up routine at the beginning of the application (splash.msp)
from its original location (browse.msp) so to perform a checkup
as soon as the application is started.

Another time-consuming job has been harmonizing texts and dialogs
and making all pages to refer at the same library.

To avoid problems we loaded the /LIB folder with all libraries
currently available, so should a page call other than dbmax25.max
it will not generate errors.
This is due to the fact that the "donor" application itself has 
been made by some new pages and some "inherited" from other apps,

This is an example of "rough" but highly efficient modularity
"a-la-Clipper".

Feel free to modify this application to fit your needs or/and
to eliminate bugs and unwanted behaviours.

For example there are several parts of code for adding new
records or editing those already existing.
This part is not necessary for purpouses of this application
and is an unwanted legacy of the "donor" app.

Eliminating this code would have been easy, but we intentionally 
left it in place for educational purpouses.
