<p><b>Interactive MaxScript: the Command Prompt</b><br>
MaxScript comes with this small app that will show the results of any statements you feed it. <br>
		Playing with MaxScript code in interactive sessions like this is a 
terrific way to learn the language.</p>
<p><b>How to use</b><br>
You need to write some code in the command window in order to see it working.&nbsp;<br>
To get an idea on how the thing works just click on&nbsp;Quick start&nbsp;to load the default example, then click on&nbsp;Run.<br>
If you don't know what to test and want to learn MaxScript at the same time just navigate the&nbsp;Sintax help, choose a language element (like USE) select the text 
of the example provided and copy (or drag) the selection to the black board, placing it ALWAYS between&nbsp;&lt;%&nbsp;and%&gt;&nbsp;tags.<br>
Then click on&nbsp;Run.<br>
If you get confused just click on&nbsp;Clear&nbsp;and start over again.</p>
<p><b>Important</b><br>
The Command Prompt is not to be intended like a developement tool: you can't write application with it!<br>
Applications are made of multiple pages linked togheter, while here you work always on the same page: anyway you can test here your code and save it to a text 
file for a later use.<br>
<br>
This simple application is not an authoring tool for MaxScript: to make any serious work you still need to use a specific software as Microsoft FrontPage or 
Macromedia Dreamweaver.<br>
The sole purpouse of this tool is to help you in your first steps with MaxScript, test the example included with MaxScript Programmer's Reference and eventually to do 
little experimenting of your own.</p>
<p>The black area of the screen is the command window: you can type your code there.<br>
Code is not immediately available: you must save it before to try to run it.<br>
This is done in the background by clicking the RUN button on top left of the screen.<br>
When you click it the code you wrote is saved into a temporary file, then merged with header and footer supplied with the app (and that you can edit) to add the 
necessary MaxScript settings for execution and it is finally launched in a dedicated window (iframe).<br>
Because of this mechanism, the application&nbsp;requires write permissions&nbsp;for its folder.</p>
<p>The environment<br>
The code will run in a standard page making use the new dedicated MaxScript header 995: all webVars and libraries used by this header are available without the 
need to call it explicitly in the prompt window (as they are added at runtime by reading files&nbsp;header.txt&nbsp;and&nbsp;footer.txt&nbsp;located in the current app folder).<br>
The default database for the command prompt is&nbsp;demo&nbsp;(i.e. issuing&nbsp;setDb(&quot;demo&quot;)) but obviously you can change it writing your own code.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browser compatibility<br>
This new version tries to address the previous issues caused by the pop-up blocking of recent browsers and those caused by the tabbed navigation by keeping all 
user interface in the same page using an&nbsp;iframe&nbsp;for the results. This way the results will be always shown in the same window.&nbsp;<br>
Anyway all browsers tend to cache files! The&nbsp;prompt page&nbsp;has the proper tags not to be cached, but some browser seems to ignore it.<br>
In this case you will need to refresh&nbsp;manually&nbsp;before to see your code in action.</p>
<p>Important notice<br>
This distribution does not necessarily include the&nbsp;Reference Archives&nbsp;(DBF files) needed by&nbsp;Sintax Help&nbsp;to work (or if included they may be outdated).<br>
Be always shure to download the latest versions from the MaxScript web site.<br>
